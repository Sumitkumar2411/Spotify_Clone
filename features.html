            Your artist profile is an important part of how you show up on
            Spotify and how fans are able to connect with you. It’s the place
            new listeners go to learn more about you as an artist and fans go to
            dive deeper into the world around your music.
            <br /><br />
            Millions of fans around the world visit artists’ profiles every
            single day and 90% of those fans interact with the page in some way.
            This real estate is key when it comes to creating fan connections.
            <br /><br />
            To help you capture listener interest, we've revamped your artist
            profile with a brand new design that organizes your music, concerts,
            merch, and more into three different tabs, bringing fans a better
            way to engage with you and all that you have to offer on Spotify.
            The new design highlights important offers like concert tickets and
            merch in dedicated tabs, so your fans can shop your offers more
            easily and you can earn more revenue through Spotify.
            <br /><br />
            Your artist profile is one of the most important ways to represent
            your brand and music – And the good news is that you can customize
            your artist profile in Spotify for Artists, so you can show the
            world who you are and what your brand is all about. Let's take a
            tour through the artist profile to learn how to set yourself up for
            success, and ultimately draw fans in. All of your profile content
            can be found under three main tabs: Music, Events, and Merch. Below
            is a breakdown of each tab:

            <p class="section-paragraph">
              <strong>Fan Support</strong> lets you highlight a fundraising
              destination — for yourself, your team, or a cause — by setting up
              a Fan Support link via Spotify for Artists and by following these
              best practices. <br /><br />
              <strong>Popular</strong> showcases your top tracks automatically
              ranked based on the number of all-time and recent streams. They
              update every 24 hours. You can’t manually change your popular
              tracks. <br /><br />
              <strong>Artist Pick</strong> helps you spotlight what's important
              to you – be it your release, a playlist, show announcements,
              merch, or a podcast – which you can set or change at any time in
              Spotify for Artists. By default, your Artist Pick will expire
              after six months, so remember to change it up to keep it fresh for
              your fans. You can add an artist comment to your Pick, as well, to
              give additional context. <br /><br />
              <strong>Popular releases</strong> spotlights your most-streamed
              albums, EPs, and singles, accounting for recency as well.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Featuring</strong> displays the playlists you appear on,
              both editorial and algorithmic, such as “This Is…” and radio
              playlists. <br /><br />
              <strong>Clips</strong> lets you give fans more insight into you
              and your music. You can upload Clips: under-30-second vertical
              videos that allow you to express your artistry and invite fans
              into your creative process, all while keeping your music
              front-and-center.
              <em

              <br /><br />
              <strong>About</strong> is where your artist bio lives. Make sure
              to keep your bio up-to-date by following these steps, and check
              out our tips for making the most out of those 1500 characters. If
              you add photos to your image gallery or set up your social links
              (Facebook, X, Instagram, and Wikipedia), those will show in your
              About section, too. <br /><br />
              <strong>Artist Playlists</strong> let you feature any playlist on
              your artist profile. Show a playlist your music’s been added to,
              or just what you’re into – learn more here. <br /><br />
              <strong>Fans Also Like</strong> recommends artists that your fans
              might be interested in based on your sound and their listening
              habits. We’ve recently updated Fans Also Like so now, even more
              artists will have a Fans Also Like section on their profile, and
              the data will more accurately reflect what your fans are listening
              to. We’ll continue refining the feature to ensure even greater
              accuracy over time. <br /><br />
              <strong>Appears On</strong> shows the albums and compilations that
              you have been a contributor on as an artist, songwriter, or
              producer.

            profile. Fans can visit this tab to discover your events happening
            near them. Fans can see up to five of your upcoming and nearby shows
            so they can browse, save for later by using the ‘Interested’ button,
            purchase tickets while they are listening to your music, right on
            Spotify. These events are automatically updated from our third party

            Testing a dedicated events tab resulted in a 70% surge in user

            We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again; merch and music are
            better together! That’s why we created a dedicated space within your
            artist profile where fans can browse and shop your available merch,
            linked from Shopify.
          </p>

          <p class="section-paragraph">
            You can now show off up to 12 merch items in the merch tab so you
            can continue to build a meaningful relationship with your fans and
            they can show their support. You can give up to two items top
            billing on the merch tab by “pinning” them in Spotify for Artists.
            Otherwise, your most recently listed items will appear first. Our
            testing has shown that featuring your merch in a dedicated tab and
            showing more items results in more fan interactions and merch
            purchases. We saw a 22% increase in users purchasing a merch item
            when visiting the merch tab on an artist’s profile.
